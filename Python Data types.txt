In Python, there are several built-in data types that are used to store different kinds of information. Some of the most common data types in Python are:

1. Integers (int): These are whole numbers, both positive and negative.

2. Floating-point numbers (float): These are numbers with decimal points.

3. Strings (str): These are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes (either single or double).

4. Booleans (bool): These are either True or False.

5. Lists (list): These are ordered sequences of items enclosed in square brackets. Lists can contain elements of any data type.

6. Tuples (tuple): These are ordered sequences of items enclosed in parentheses. Tuples can contain elements of any data type.

7. Dictionaries (dict): These are collections of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces. Keys are unique and must be immutable (like strings or integers), while values can be of any data type.

8. Sets (set): These are unordered collections of unique elements enclosed in curly braces or generated by using the set() function.

9. NoneType (None): This is a special data type in Python that represents the absence of a value.

10. Bytes and byte arrays (bytes and bytearray): These are used to represent sequences of bytes, usually used for handling binary data.
